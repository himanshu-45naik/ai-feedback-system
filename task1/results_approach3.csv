4,4.0,"The review is largely positive. While acknowledging it was empty late night, the reviewer enjoyed the food, service, and cocktails. The 'old Uno's' comment is neutral/slightly positive (nostalgia). The update about the patio adds further positive reinforcement. The location being the reason for late-night emptiness isn't a criticism of the bar itself. Overall, it's a positive experience with a minor timing caveat.","We got here around midnight last Friday... the place was dead. However, they were still serving food..."
5,5.0,"The review expresses extremely positive sentiment, with a direct comparison to authentic Louisiana cuisine and a claim of being 'the best' outside of the state. This is strong praise and indicates a highly satisfying experience.",Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's ha...
3,3.0,"The review is generally positive (""good"", ""hits the spot"", regular visits with dad) but lacks strong enthusiasm. The phrase ""typical strip mall pizza"" suggests it's not exceptional, just adequate. The sentiment is moderate, and there are no specific complaints, leading to a neutral-to-positive assessment.","Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and filln..."
1,1.0,"The review expresses extremely negative sentiment with strong language (""really, really disappointed,"" ""flat out denied,"" ""VERY hard to believe""). The core complaint is a massive, unnecessary repair quote followed by a simple, inexpensive fix at another shop, suggesting dishonesty or incompetence. The customer is actively switching brands due to this experience. This indicates a severe issue and warrants a 1-star rating.","My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We broug..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""Love,"" ""amazing,"" and ""Must try!"" The customer repeatedly visited the restaurant during a three-week trip, indicating high satisfaction. There are no complaints, only enthusiastic praise for specific dishes and the variety of the menu. This demonstrates a strong recommendation.",Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  ...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting good location, price, free parking and breakfast, cleanliness, and room size. While there are minor negatives (noise from neighbors, potential for street noise though not experienced by the reviewer), these are outweighed by the positives. The reviewer explicitly states they would stay again, indicating a strong positive experience.","This hotel is in a good location for getting to the sports venues downtown, the convention center or..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting excellent food quality (specifically seafood, sushi, and several dishes) and a very late serving time (2 AM). The service is acknowledged as inconsistent ('hit and miss'), but the reviewer details a positive experience when proactively seeking service at the sushi bar. The happy hour and drink prices are also praised. While the service isn't perfect, the strong positive aspects regarding the food outweigh the service concern, leading to a 4-star rating.",I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices. The services is hit and miss but once i w...
4,5.0,"The review uses extremely positive language (""Awesome,"" ""awesomer"") and expresses strong enthusiasm for both ramen and boba tea. The exclamation points further emphasize the positive sentiment. There are no complaints, only praise, indicating a highly positive experience.",Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""Great,"" ""favorite,"" and ""awesome."" It highlights multiple positive aspects (seating options, food quality, portion sizes) and a consistently busy atmosphere, indicating popularity. The tone is enthusiastic and there are no complaints. This strongly suggests a 5-star experience.","Great place for a ""home office"" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Alway..."
1,1.0,"The review expresses strong negative sentiment ('not ok', 'literally', 'little to no meat', 'will not be going back'). The core complaint is consistently insufficient meat portions across multiple orders, indicating a significant and repeated service/product issue. The 1-star rating for service reinforces this negative experience. The intensity is strong due to the repeated nature of the problem and the definitive statement of not returning.","1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I l..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting good food, efficient service for a large group, and a reasonable price. Specific dishes are praised. The tone is enthusiastic. While not effusive, it indicates a very positive experience with only minor potential issues (none explicitly stated).",Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasn't a long wait at ...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""great"" repeatedly and highlighting positive aspects like accommodating staff, happy hour prices, and a good atmosphere. The reviewer even addresses a potential negative (music) and explains how it's easily resolved. The final comment about having the 'right mind' is a lighthearted addition, not a genuine complaint. The intensity is strong due to the enthusiastic language.","This place is great!
If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.
You can bring..."
3,5.0,"The review expresses extremely positive sentiment with the phrase ""Air Jordan! need I say more?"" This implies a very high level of satisfaction and brand recognition. The tone is enthusiastic and confident, indicating a strong recommendation. There are no complaints, only implied praise.",Air Jordan! need I say more?
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting convenience, good prices, selection, and helpful nearby businesses. The only negative point is a caution about the deli staff, but it's framed with understanding and a suggestion for how to mitigate the issue, rather than a harsh complaint. The acknowledgement of another reviewer's point about parking suggests a minor inconvenience, but not a dealbreaker. The detailed praise of specific items available at this location demonstrates strong satisfaction.",There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of ...
5,5.0,"The review expresses strong gratitude and highlights exceptional customer service – specifically, helpful guidance during an emergency and prompt action to resolve the issue. Phrases like ""very grateful"" and the promise of continued referrals indicate a highly positive experience. There are no complaints, only praise.",TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through...
2,3.0,"The review expresses mixed feelings. While the burger itself is deemed 'good' (positive), the high prices and average fries (negative) bring the overall experience down. The tone is neutral to slightly negative, and the intensity of complaints is moderate. The recommendation to 'stick with the burger and skip the rest' suggests it's passable but not exceptional, aligning with a 3-star rating.","So I was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since it's President Obama's favorite... 
Th..."
4,3.0,"The review is largely mixed. While the reviewer acknowledges the quality of Neiman Marcus's products, they express discomfort with the store's atmosphere and a specific negative experience with the registry process (misspelled name). The overall tone is not strongly negative, but leans towards dissatisfaction, and a clear preference for other department stores is stated. This suggests a neutral to slightly negative experience, fitting a 3-star rating.","I really don't consider myself a Neiman's type of girl...
As a matter of fact, I don't really feel c..."
4,4.0,"The review is mostly positive, highlighting a helpful option ('petite' burger) for calorie-conscious diners. While it mentions the high calorie count of the regular burger and fries (a negative point), the overall tone is appreciative and provides a useful tip. The intensity is moderate – it's not ecstatic praise, but a solid recommendation for a specific need. There are no severe complaints.","I have been trying to reduce my caloric intake and found out that at Red Robin you can order a ""peti..."
5,5.0,"The review uses overwhelmingly positive language (""Great,"" ""awesome,"" ""must have""). The exclamation points further amplify the positive sentiment. There are no complaints, only enthusiastic praise for both the pizza and the guacamole appetizer. This indicates a highly positive experience.",Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer!!!!
5,4.0,"The review is mostly positive, highlighting the airport's convenience and speed (20 minutes from landing to rental car). While it acknowledges the limited airline options (Allegiant only) and suggests avoiding onboard snacks, these are minor inconveniences. The tone is generally appreciative, despite the slightly quirky description of the airport and its destinations. The 'quaint' and 'convenient' descriptors are positive indicators.",This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa are...
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the burger's taste and noting improvement with the fries. The complaints (styrofoam cups, drink size, messiness) are minor inconveniences rather than dealbreakers. The tone is enthusiastic and the reviewer explicitly states they weren't disappointed, indicating a strong positive experience.",Headed back to Lobby's. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasn't disappointed with round 2. The burg...
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the food quality, taste, value, and staff friendliness. The primary drawback is the location and ambiance (being in a casino), but the reviewer explicitly states it's 'worth a visit' despite this. The consistent positive experiences ('20 times and still never had a bad dish') and reasonable pricing contribute to a strong positive sentiment, though the casino setting prevents a full 5-star rating.",Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include g...
1,1.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, citing rude staff, unclear pricing, overpriced activities, uncomfortable temperatures, and malfunctioning equipment. The intensity of the complaints is strong, with words like 'rude,' 'extreme' (used negatively), and 'malfunctioned' indicating significant issues. The reviewer explicitly states they won't return, solidifying a very poor experience.","Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling ..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting excellent staff service (helpful, friendly, knowledgeable) and a fantastic pool area. The room is described as 'okay' - clean and updated, but with a noise issue. The banquet food is 'good' with minor complaints about saltiness, but the break service is 'astonishing'. These minor issues don't detract significantly from the positive experiences, leading to a 4-star rating.",The staff is really helpful.  I arrived without credit card due to a travel mishap and they were gre...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting fresh, hot food cooked to order, friendly service, and delicious onion rings and a burger. The tone is enthusiastic and includes a stated intention to return. The only minor aspect preventing a 5-star rating is the lack of extensive detail – it's a good review, but doesn't go *above and beyond* in describing the experience.","Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like ..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Sentiment indicators include ""tasty,"" ""fully satisfied,"" ""perfectly cooked,"" ""refreshing,"" and ""good option."" While they didn't get burritos (a slight deviation from expectation), the specific praise for the pork and horchata is strong. The comment about value (""without breaking your wallet"") adds to the positive impression. Intensity is moderate to strong, leaning towards strong with the descriptive language used. There are no complaints, only a mention of not ordering the restaurant's namesake dish.","After browsing at the Bookman's next door, we were feeling hungry and were tempted by the notion of ..."
1,2.0,"The review expresses a negative sentiment with the phrase ""way too high!"" indicating dissatisfaction with pricing. While concise, the intensity is moderate to strong due to the use of ""way."" There are no redeeming qualities mentioned. This suggests significant problems with value, leading to a 2-star rating.",Prices are often way too high!
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting good value (2 for $13.99 special, happy hour), fast and friendly service, and tasty food (especially the chop steak, steak, and salmon). The only negative points are the price of the first drink in the 2-for-1 deal and a comment about it not being 'classy' or having 'the best food,' but these are mild criticisms and are balanced by numerous positives. The reviewer's expectations were exceeded, and they express a clear fondness for several aspects of the restaurant.",I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never h...
2,2.0,"The review is largely negative. A key tool (wood saw) is frequently unavailable, and prices are higher than a competitor. While the garden department and checkout speed receive neutral/slightly positive comments, the 'strange' staff and overall 'Meh' tone indicate significant dissatisfaction. The issues outweigh the positives.","The wood saw is always out of service...
The garden department is nice, but the staff is a little st..."
2,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative due to extremely poor service – long waits, lack of basic amenities, and unprofessional server behavior (dumping/throwing items). While the food, specifically the burrata, receives praise, it's insufficient to offset the terrible service experience. The lack of any attempt to compensate for the issues further contributes to the negative assessment. The reviewer hopes the experience was an anomaly, suggesting it's not representative of the restaurant's usual standard, but the immediate experience was significantly flawed.",I've never been to a restaurant where we (a party of 6 with a reservation) sat at a cleared table wi...
1,1.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, detailing significant issues with all three dishes ordered (Mongolian beef, Kung Po chicken, and Pad Thai). Words like ""bland,"" ""non existent,"" ""Blah,"" ""dry,"" and ""clump"" indicate strong dissatisfaction. The reviewer explicitly states they will not return and recommends others go elsewhere. The need to add peanut sauce to make the Pad Thai edible highlights a major failing. This points to a very poor experience.","My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, M..."
1,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, filled with frustration and annoyance. While the writer attempts humor, the core experience was riddled with issues: no pay-at-the-pump, a confusing payment system, a strange nozzle obstruction, and a malfunctioning receipt printer. The tone is sarcastic and angry ('Stupid ampm station,' 'Screw this'). The disclaimer, while humorous, underscores the writer's feeling of being unfairly inconvenienced. The intensity is strong due to the repeated expressions of frustration and the vow to never return. There is no praise offered.","Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moro..."
3,4.0,"The review is mostly positive. While the location is noted as not great and the slaw needs improvement, the pulled pork is highly praised (8/10) and the beans are good despite a slight spice. The reviewer explicitly states they will return, indicating a positive overall experience. These factors suggest a rating of 4 stars – mostly positive with minor issues.","Found this place by accident.  Not the greatest location.

The pulled pork rates about an 8 on my sc..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, filled with enthusiastic language (""cutest place ever,"" ""countrilicous,"" ""good,"" ""sturdy and aromatic""). While there's acknowledgement of a 'yuppified' clientele and a humorous aside about omelette-related trauma, these don't detract significantly from the praise. The reviewer clearly has a strong fondness for the breakfast and the quirky atmosphere. The tone is lighthearted and playful, indicating a very positive experience. The minor comments don't bring the rating down to a 5 as they are more observational than critical.",I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak Ge...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong language like ""cleanest,"" ""most efficient EVER,"" ""absolutely,"" and highlighting consistent cleanliness and employee friendliness. The reviewer explicitly contrasts this Subway favorably with others, stating they ""can't say that about many Subways."" There are no complaints, only praise for the orderliness and pride in work shown by the staff. This indicates a highly positive experience and a strong recommendation.","This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been ..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like ""family vibe,"" ""down to earth,"" ""friendly vibe,"" and explicitly stating a recommendation to friends and family. The reviewer highlights multiple positive aspects of the shop – the artists, the atmosphere, and the importance of consultation/portfolio review. There are no complaints, only encouragement. The tone is enthusiastic and reassuring, particularly addressing potential anxieties about tattoo shops.",I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tat...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like 'simply the best,' 'perfect,' and 'consummate.' The praise is specific (Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil sandwich, focaccia bread texture) and enthusiastic. The only negative element is a wistful comment about distance, which doesn't detract from the food's quality.","Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.

The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect. The focacci..."
5,4.0,"The review is mostly positive. The reviewer explicitly states they 'really liked' the chicken and waffles and would 'definitely go back' for the same. The lemonade was also enjoyed. While there are complaints about portion sizes for the price and a negative comment about the Reese's pancakes, these are relatively minor. The wait time and crowding are acknowledged but not heavily criticized. The overall tone is enthusiastic despite the few drawbacks.","Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the brisket and ribs as 'delicious' and the beans as 'loved'. The root beer also receives strong positive feedback ('YUM'). The only negatives are a preference against cafeteria-style ordering and the ribs needing added sauce, and a differing opinion on the coleslaw – all relatively minor issues. The warning about the long wait time is informational, not a complaint about the food itself. The intensity of the positive comments is moderate to strong, while the negatives are mild.","Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the bri..."
2,1.0,"The review uses extremely negative language (""wasted,"" ""never again"") indicating a very poor experience. The tone is highly dissatisfied and there are no redeeming qualities mentioned. This points to a 1-star rating.",Well I just wasted 38 bucks....never again
3,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, consistently comparing the restaurant unfavorably to competitors (Capital Grille, Craftsteak, 1130, Ruth's Chris, IHOP). While service is noted as 'great' at dinner and 'fine' at breakfast, the food quality is described as 'mediocre,' 'overpriced,' and consistently worse than alternatives. The tone is disappointed and critical, with phrases like 'nothing blew my socks off' and 'Come on, Hilton!'. The intensity is moderate to strong due to the repeated negative comparisons and the $120 value assessment.","While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To su..."
1,2.0,"The review expresses strong dissatisfaction with the food quality, specifically the steak, despite acknowledging excellent service. The cramped seating and unpleasant surrounding conversations further detract from the experience. While past experiences were positive, this visit was significantly negative, leading to a low overall rating. The comparison to higher-end steakhouses highlights the perceived value discrepancy.","I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
Service was excellent, and highly attenti..."
1,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, using extremely strong and disturbing language (comparing the venue to 'To Catch A Predator' and referencing 'pervert skin'). While there are a few minor positives mentioned (appeal to under-21s, decent DJ music), they are heavily overshadowed by the intensely negative impressions of the clientele and drink quality. The overall tone is sarcastic and critical, indicating a poor experience. The categorization of patrons into three unflattering types further reinforces the negative sentiment.",Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that th...
3,3.0,"The review is largely a humorous recounting of getting lost, filled with frustration and self-deprecating humor. While the author clearly experienced a negative situation (getting lost, long hike), the tone is more comedic than angry. There's praise for the view initially, but the overall experience is presented as a cautionary tale. The intensity is moderate – strong frustration is expressed, but it's delivered with a lighthearted tone. The complaints center around poor trail marking and a misleading layout, but it doesn't seem to have ruined the trip entirely, just made it significantly more challenging and stressful.","Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directio..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong positive descriptors like ""to die for,"" ""wonderful,"" and ""great."" The only slight drawback mentioned is the price, but the reviewer acknowledges this is expected for a W Hotel and doesn't strongly detract from the experience. The welcoming atmosphere and lack of strict dress code are also highlighted as positives. Therefore, a 4-star rating is appropriate, indicating mostly positive feedback with a minor price concern.","Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting im..."
4,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Words like ""rocks"", ""bargain"", ""best"", ""friendly"", and ""kind"" indicate strong positive sentiment. The reviewer specifically praises the food quality, spice level, staff, and price. Even the playful comment about sticking to red/yellow curries reinforces a positive experience. There are no complaints, only enthusiastic praise, making a 5-star rating appropriate.","Decor  functional 
Staff friendly and are really kind to our toddler
food rocks  within my  limited ..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting a well-organized store, friendly staff, and a good selection of quality products. While the reviewer notes prices can be high without the coupon, the coupon mitigates this issue. The reviewer's intention to return and the 'Thanks' at the end further indicate satisfaction. The lack of finding the initial desired item is a minor drawback, not significantly impacting the overall positive experience.","I was looking for a comforter for my new bed when I realized that this B,B, and B was close by so I ..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong language like ""ABSOLUTE BEST"" and detailing specific positive attributes of the crab salad (fresh, clean, sweet, crisp, light). The reviewer also praises the iced tea and the setting. The tone is enthusiastic and ends with a strong recommendation (""Go there...Eat there...you will like it...""). There are no complaints.",I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting excellent food quality (especially the seared tuna and rolls), fair pricing, and a pleasant experience despite minor interior quirks. While the reviewer acknowledges mixed Yelp reviews and a slightly strange interior, these are presented as minor issues. The strong positive language ('divine,' 'happy,' 'absolutely fair,' 'huge,' 'flavorful,' 'tender') and the stated intention to return indicate a high level of satisfaction. The 'Ichi the Killer Roll' comment is playful, not critical. Therefore, a 4-star rating is appropriate, reflecting mostly positive feedback with minor caveats.","While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in..."
1,1.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, filled with strong negative sentiment (""WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER"", ""wasting my time"", ""costing me money""). The customer experienced a significant delay, leading to a financial loss (non-refundable class fee). The complaints are specific and severe: lateness, getting lost despite being a taxi service, repeated unnecessary calls, and ultimately, failing to provide the service requested. The intensity is very strong due to the financial impact and frustrated tone.","If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  A..."
1,1.0,"The review expresses overwhelmingly negative sentiment. Strong negative descriptors like ""awful,"" ""bad,"" and ""greasy"" are used repeatedly. Specific complaints include incorrect meat in a dish (lemon chicken being pork), poorly made wontons, and low-quality lo mein and eggrolls. The reviewer explicitly states they will go to Panda Express instead, indicating a very low opinion of the current restaurant. The initial positive sentiment regarding previous ownership is overshadowed by the current experience.",When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous r...
3,3.0,"The review expresses a generally positive sentiment *relative* to Denny's, but qualifies it as 'okay' and 'not the best'. The preference for Waffle House over Denny's is a positive, but the overall tone is lukewarm. It's a mixed review indicating an acceptable experience, but not a highly enthusiastic one.",I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""thrilled,"" ""awesome,"" and ""decent"" multiple times. The unique atmosphere is heavily praised, and while the food isn't described as exceptional, it's considered ""fairly decent."" The only minor aspect is that the food is not the primary draw, but the experience is. The exclamation points and enthusiastic tone contribute to a strong positive sentiment.","Neat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place is like a trip to a non-petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while y..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive despite acknowledging the restaurant is 'a bit shabby'. Strong positive indicators include 'delicious' food, 'friendly' staff, and willingness to 'fix' issues. 'Decent' prices are neutral. The long-term patronage ('years') suggests consistent satisfaction. The slight drawback of the ambiance doesn't significantly detract from the overall positive experience, making it a solid 4-star establishment.","I've been going to this place for years, and they have always stayed true to their own style.  The p..."
4,4.0,"The review is largely positive, despite some food criticisms. The initial breakdown averages to a 4, and while individual items like the burger are 'nothing spectacular,' the beer selection and knowledgeable staff are highly praised. The 'check-in deal' boosts the overall experience. The sampler warning and beer recommendations demonstrate engagement and a positive experience with the beer offerings. While the food isn't a standout, the beer and atmosphere elevate the experience to a solid 4 stars.","Beer is almost a 4, food is a 3, service was a 4.5.  + Check in deal makes it a 5.  Add that up and ..."
3,3.0,"The review expresses mixed feelings. There's strong positive sentiment towards the layout and view, and a desire to support the business. However, the high drink prices and limited options are significant negatives, and there's uncertainty about the 'dance club' concept. This balances out to a neutral/mixed experience, warranting a 3-star rating.","I love the layout of this outdoor bar. However, the price of drinks here and the lack of well option..."
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive despite a minor drink order error. Strong positive descriptors like 'melted in my mouth,' 'so worth it,' 'great atmosphere,' 'good service,' 'great food,' and 'fun atmosphere' dominate. The intensity of the praise is strong. The drink mistake is acknowledged but framed positively ('happy about the mistake'). The comment about the bread pudding is humorous and doesn't detract from the overall positive experience. Flexible hours are also a plus. Therefore, a 4-star rating is appropriate, acknowledging the minor issue but emphasizing the excellent overall experience.","The waiter got the drink wrong: ""up"" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but I was ..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like ""in love,"" ""super delicious,"" and ""yummm."" The tone is enthusiastic, and the reviewer explicitly states they ""can't wait to go back."" The mention of specific flavors and toppings further reinforces the positive experience. There are no complaints, only praise, and the price is noted as ""inexpensive,"" adding to the positive assessment.",I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo!!  It is super delicious and inexpensive!!  I got the coconut an...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Strong sentiment indicators include 'never been disappointed,' 'excellent service,' 'friendly,' and 'with a smile.' The reviewer explicitly states they've tried the entire menu repeatedly and have a clear favorite, demonstrating high satisfaction. The intensity is strong due to the repeated positive affirmations and enthusiastic description of the food. There are no complaints whatsoever.",I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu proba...
1,2.0,"The review expresses significant disappointment with a decline in quality and service compared to past experiences. While there's nostalgia for a positive past, the current experience is heavily criticized with complaints about price increases, portion size reduction, lack of assistance, and poor tea service. The tone is negative and the issues are substantial, warranting a 2-star rating.",We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish an...
2,1.0,The review details two significant negative experiences: arriving before opening hours and then finding the establishment closed *during* opening hours. The tone is frustrated and the experience clearly prevented the customer from receiving the service they intended. This indicates a severe operational issue and a very negative customer experience.,Writing my 7/29/11 review prompted me to return to this establishment for a manicure. I got there at...
2,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative. While the beans are described as 'ok' (neutral), the primary complaints – under-seasoning, store-bought tortillas, and a stated lack of intent to return – indicate significant dissatisfaction. The comparison to 'better places' further reinforces the negative sentiment. The intensity is moderate to strong due to the definitive statement of not returning.",This place is way under seasoned.  The beans were ok.  I hate that they use store bought tortillas. ...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting a fun atmosphere, good bar service, and enjoyable activities (Jenga, dancing, outdoor space). The negative points (bathroom condition) are acknowledged but framed as minor and expected for a 'dive bar' type establishment. The reviewer explicitly states they had a 'blast' and a 'good time' on both visits. While food is not a highlight, it's not presented as a major drawback. The intensity of the positive sentiment is strong, outweighing the mild negative comments.","If you appreciate a good dive bar, you will love this place!  We came here for the first time when o..."
3,3.0,"The review expresses mixed feelings. While acknowledging Target's consistent branding (neutral/slightly positive), the reviewer is disappointed it isn't a 'flagship' store given its location in an upscale shopping center (negative). The strong negative sentiment regarding traffic and parking significantly impacts the overall experience, but the core Target experience itself isn't criticized. This results in a neutral to slightly negative overall impression, leaning towards a 3-star rating.",As Target's go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. Howev...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive regarding the food (delicious, reasonably sized, good value) and the overall experience is favorable despite a significant negative – the dirty dining room. The reviewer explicitly states they'd give 5 stars if not for the cleanliness issue, aligning with a 4-star rating. The initial anecdote adds a charming, relatable element without detracting from the core assessment.","Let's rewind four years:

""You've never been to Chino Bandido?""
""No, what is it?""
""How long have you..."
2,3.0,"The review is largely mixed. While starting with disappointment (""I REALLY wanted this to be good""), it acknowledges a ""cool concept"" and ""great crust."" However, the core complaints about the pizzas, salad, and gelato being flawed (lacking soul, too salty/soggy, artificial tasting) outweigh the positives. The 'better than Pizza Hut' comment positions it as acceptable, but the expectation gap is significant given the restaurant's branding and price point. This points to a neutral experience with some redeeming qualities but ultimately falling short of potential.","Ahh man,
.....I REALLY wanted this to be good.

But honestly, you end up with something that's more ..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like ""WOW"", ""WONDERFUL!!!"", and ""BEST I have ever had"". Both entrees received high praise, and the reviewer explicitly states they will make this a ""usual stop"" during future visits. The tone is enthusiastic and highly recommends the restaurant.",WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Cha...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Strong positive sentiment indicators like ""Favorite,"" ""Great,"" ""tender,"" ""Friendly,"" and ""Nom nom"" are present. The reviewer specifically praises the meat quality and expresses intent to return, indicating a high level of satisfaction. There are no complaints, making this a strong recommendation.","Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.

2,2.0,"The review expresses negative sentiment with words like ""wasn't impressed"" and describes specific quality issues (""store bought"" dressing, ""very very mushy"" tomatoes). The intensity is moderate due to the direct complaints, but doesn't indicate a complete disaster. Therefore, a 2-star rating is appropriate.",Wasn't impressed. Dressing tasted like a store bought bottle dressing and tomatoes very very mushy.
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting a 'great time,' 'cool' atmosphere, tasty apps, awesome service, and a clear intention to return. The only negative point is a mild dislike for the calamari, which is framed as a matter of preference ('not our style') rather than a quality issue. The intensity of the positive sentiment is moderate to strong, justifying a 4-star rating.",This review is specifically for my experience at Trader Vic's last night (a Saturday night) for Happ...
3,3.0,"The review is mixed. While the reviewer explicitly states the 3 stars are *solely* for the veggie sandwich (positive), they also detail significant service issues – slow turnaround and only one staff member. The suggestions for workarounds (pre-order, delivery) indicate acceptance of these issues rather than strong dissatisfaction, leading to a neutral overall rating. The tone is generally pragmatic and slightly humorous ('A girls gotta eat! :)'), further supporting a 3-star assessment.","I'm giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason: 
The veggie sandwich! 

There's normally only 1 person w..."
2,2.0,"The review expresses a strong negative sentiment regarding the current state of the restaurant, contrasting it with a positive past experience. While acknowledging a good past, the present is described as a significant decline ('DOWNHILL, big time') directly linked to franchising. The sarcastic name suggestion further emphasizes dissatisfaction. The intensity is strong, but the nostalgia for a past positive experience prevents a 1-star rating.","Years ago, and I do mean years ago, their Mill Avenue location in Tempe, was outstanding.

As they e..."
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like ""doesn't get any better,"" ""truly unique,"" ""good, tasty, and satisfying."" The pros list is substantial and positive. The only con is the small interior, which is a minor issue. The tone is enthusiastic and the intensity is strong in its praise, despite acknowledging the humble nature of the establishment. The detailed description of the pasty and specific recommendations further indicate a positive experience.",Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this p...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'great,' 'nice,' 'coolest,' 'awesome,' and 'fabulous.' While it acknowledges another bar ('Charlie's') is also good, it clearly positions Oz as a preferred choice. The praise is specific (Booker, jukebox, Stephanie Ann, prices, location) and enthusiastic. The tone is lighthearted and affectionate. The only minor aspect preventing a 5-star rating is the comparison to another bar, suggesting it's not *uniquely* excellent, but a strong alternative.","Oz is a great local bar and a nice change from the bumping Charlie's (which, don't get me wrong, is ..."
3,3.0,"The review is mixed. There's strong positive sentiment towards the atmosphere and customer service, but a significant negative regarding the value of the steak (price vs. quality and lack of included side). The 'don't think I will be eating here again' statement is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction despite the positives, leading to a neutral overall rating.","Love the atmosphere and how trendy rhus place is, reminds me of Nip/tuck kinda, the way they have it..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""terrific,"" ""great,"" and highlighting the ease and community benefit of the donation program. There are no complaints, only praise for the process and the people at the location. The tone is enthusiastic and appreciative, indicating a strong positive experience.",I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific...
2,2.0,"The review expresses significant frustration with double billing incidents, despite acknowledging a convenience factor (location). The tone is negative and includes a 'fair warning,' indicating a serious concern. While not explicitly stating malicious intent, the repeated billing issues are a major problem, outweighing the convenience. The initial statement about *always* paying cash suggests a lack of trust, further supporting a low rating.","I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's. If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here a..."
5,5.0,"The review uses extremely positive sentiment indicators (""love love"", ""amazing"", ""cute"", ""artsy""). The intensity is strong due to the repetition of ""love"" and the enthusiastic adjectives. There are no complaints, only praise. This indicates a highly positive experience and a strong recommendation.",I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.
3,4.0,"The review is mostly positive. The atmosphere, salsa bar, mole, calabacitas, and partner's pork taco all receive praise. The only significant negative is the blandness of the carne asada, which was mitigated by adding salsa. The reviewer expresses intent to return, indicating overall satisfaction despite the one disappointing dish. This points to a 4-star experience – mostly positive with a minor issue.",La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get in...
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, with strong praise for the Stetson chopped salad and bread pudding. While the mushrooms were initially found bland due to sequencing with the bolder salad, the reviewer acknowledged their quality when eaten later. Service and drink selection also received high marks. The only minor issue is the flavor transition between courses, not a significant detractor.","Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta..."
4,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong positive sentiment indicators like ""Yum!"", ""Delicious"", ""wonderful"", and ""devine!"". There are no complaints, only enthusiastic praise for both the pizza and the Nutella crepes. This indicates a highly satisfying experience.","Yum! Delicious tasting pizza, a wonderful atmosphere, and oh those  Nutella crepes are devine!"
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Phrases like ""more than enough!"", ""very friendly and patient"", and ""Nice place"" indicate strong positive sentiment. The comment about the sandwich being ""just good"" is slightly lukewarm, preventing a 5-star rating, but doesn't detract significantly from the overall positive experience. Intensity is moderate to strong.","I had a chicken panini and was more than enough! It was dinner and lunch!

They have this special br..."
4,4.0,"The review is largely positive, highlighting standout dishes like the Pate Chaude and crispy rolls. While there are criticisms regarding slow service and some basic/bland menu items, the reviewer explicitly states they will return and rounded up their initial 3.5-star assessment. The overall tone is impressed and hopeful, despite the noted flaws.","I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... unde..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting enjoyment of the atmosphere, music, staff, and coffee. The reviewer explicitly states being a 'fan' and uses positive descriptors like 'chill,' 'nice,' and 'friendly.' The only minor aspect preventing a 5-star rating is the 'note' about not yet trying the pastries, implying a potential for improvement or further enjoyment rather than a current negative. The 4-star declaration reinforces this assessment.","I am a huge fan of local coffee shops with free wifi. I am also a huge fan of iced lattes. I know, h..."
4,4.0,"The review acknowledges the steak isn't top-tier but heavily emphasizes the atmosphere and overall 'cool' factor of Durant's. While food quality receives moderate praise (bread is 'awesome', steak/seafood 'pretty good/alright'), the consistent positive descriptions of the ambiance and its unique place in Phoenix nightlife outweigh the food criticisms. The tone is overwhelmingly positive despite the initial qualification about the steak, indicating a strong positive experience centered around the restaurant's vibe.","OK, let's face it: there are better steaks in the Valley. As a matter of fact, if you just took the ..."
5,3.0,"The review is mixed. There's strong positive sentiment towards the park's amenities (grass, fountains, seating, good crowd) and the benefit of a tired dog afterward. However, there's a notable negative aspect – the problematic behavior of some dogs and the owners' inaction, coupled with the reviewer's somewhat aggressive response. This issue prevents a higher rating, making it a generally acceptable park with a specific drawback.","This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to pla..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong language like ""best barber shop ever"" and ""top notch."" The reviewer explicitly contrasts this experience with consistently negative experiences at other establishments. The praise for Israel's skill and the attention to detail indicates a highly satisfying experience, warranting a 5-star rating.",This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was alwa...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Words like 'decent,' 'weren't pushy,' and 'frosting on the cake' indicate a positive experience. The price of the car wash and gas were good, and a senior discount was applied. There are no complaints, only positive observations. The intensity is moderate to strong due to the enthusiastic phrasing ('frosting on the cake').",Got a pretty decent HAND car wash for $15.00.  They asked about extras but weren't pushy about it.  ...
4,4.0,"The review expresses a positive sentiment with phrases like ""Home made fresh noodles"" and the positive comparison to San Francisco Chinatown food. The tone is appreciative and nostalgic. While not effusive, the comparison implies a high quality and enjoyable experience. Intensity is moderate, leaning towards strong due to the specific and positive reference point.",Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.
3,4.0,"The review is mostly positive. While the reviewer notes the store differs from a traditional hardware store, they found a product unavailable at Home Depot (HD) and at a good price. The tone is pragmatic and suggests checking this store even if you prefer HD. The praise outweighs any minor 'complaint' about the store's focus.","This really is more of a lady's hardware store with more design/decorating stuff, small appliances, ..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like ""great wine bar!"" and ""so good."" While the reviewer can't recall specifics, the overall tone is enthusiastic. The small size is presented as a positive (""cozy""). The lack of specific details slightly prevents a 5-star rating, but it's still a strong recommendation.",I found this on yelp and what a great wine bar! I went here last night after work with friends and w...
3,2.0,"The review is largely negative, despite a small positive about the omelet customization. The potatoes are heavily criticized, the burritos received no enthusiasm, and the service was slow. The positive mentions (patio, 'eye candy') are insufficient to outweigh the significant food and service issues. The tone is dismissive ('definitely one you can skip').","The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and it's nice that they let ..."
3,3.0,"The review 'Glorified Pei Wei' is a neutral to slightly negative comparison. It doesn't express outright dislike, but implies the restaurant doesn't offer anything significantly different or better than an existing, well-known chain. This suggests a 'middle-of-the-road' experience, warranting a 3-star rating. The intensity is moderate, as it's a comparative statement rather than a strong complaint or praise.",Glorified Pei Wei
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'great,' 'pleasant,' 'welcoming,' 'tasty,' 'yum,' and 'impressed.' The reviewer highlights multiple positive aspects – ambiance, service, food quality, portion sizes, complimentary items, and even restroom cleanliness. The tone is enthusiastic and ends with a strong recommendation and intention to return. There are no complaints mentioned, only praise.","Another great Italian find!

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was gi..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. While not effusive about the coffee itself ('pretty good'), the reviewer highlights a charming atmosphere, comfortable temperature, and *especially* praises the staff as a key reason for return visits. The initial disclaimer ('not a coffee snob') suggests a reasonable and balanced perspective. The tone is consistently appreciative, indicating a positive experience overall.","I'm not a coffee snob, but I love a good Americano.  

This place has the charm you'd expect from a ..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like ""amazing,"" ""far above expectations,"" ""huge and delicious,"" and ""fantastic.""

This indicates a highly satisfying experience.",Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more i...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting spacious rooms, complimentary breakfast with proper dining ware, free WiFi, and suitability for families. The only negative point is the small and underwhelming pool, which prevents a 5-star rating. The language used ('hidden jewel', 'perfect', 'comfy') indicates strong positive sentiment, while the pool critique is relatively mild.","The Hyatt Place Scottsdale is a hidden jewel in old town, just off the main drag this place is perfe..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting cleanliness, consistent stock, and short wait times. While not effusive, the consistent praise indicates a very positive experience. The tone is matter-of-fact and appreciative, suggesting high satisfaction. No complaints are present, leading to a strong positive assessment.",This is my neighborhood grocery store. It's at the two locations I shop at most. It's always clean a...
4,4.0,"The review is mostly positive, highlighting 'fantastic' food (Chicken Corfu, salads, soup) and a pleasant atmosphere with beautiful views. The negative experience with the Gyro is significant ('dry', 'burnt', 'fishy taste') but was addressed by the restaurant (removed from bill, promise to fix). This indicates a willingness to correct issues and doesn't overshadow the positive aspects, leading to a mostly positive overall impression.",Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.95 and others like the Gyro I found...
2,2.0,"The review expresses strong negative sentiment regarding the price of the ice cream, using phrases like ""a thousand dollars for a scoop"" and ""fool parting with his money."" While the reviewer acknowledges the ice cream is tasty and praises the flavor selection and sampling opportunity, the overwhelming focus is on the exorbitant cost, leading to a mostly negative experience. The two-star rating aligns with this assessment – acknowledging taste but heavily criticizing value.","If you have $6 burning a hole in your pocket, and would like a thimble full of ice cream, this is yo..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the atmosphere, beer (specifically Four Peaks), and several food items (ham & eggs, grilled cheese/soup, deviled eggs). While there are minor criticisms (wine being 'not the worst', cheese plate being average, loud music), these are outweighed by the positive aspects and the 'pleasant experience' overall. The service is described as 'acceptable' and the manager's attentiveness is noted. The tone is generally enthusiastic and appreciative, despite the few drawbacks.",Loved the atmosphere most of all.  This is a converted bungalow house that should set an example for...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong language like ""new mecca,"" ""legendary,"" and ""best place."" It expresses gratitude and a desire for the venue to succeed. While acknowledging potential future wear and tear, this is presented as a natural consequence of being a lively music venue, not a criticism. The inclusion of daily live music and early opening hours further enhances the positive impression.","This is the new mecca of Phoenix music.

4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""really nice,"" ""great,"" and ""amazing."" The tone is enthusiastic and recommends specific items (smoothies) and experiences (live music/artist). There are no complaints, only positive observations. While not *ecstatic* praise, it's a strong recommendation, justifying a 4-star rating.",This is a really nice coffee shop and restaurant tucked away in a corner toward the east end of City...
4,3.0,"The review is mixed. The reviewer clearly enjoys some dishes (ravioli, lamb kabob) and details what they liked about them. However, their mother consistently dislikes the food, and there are specific complaints about the escargots (overly crunchy pastry, bland sauce). The tone is generally positive when discussing their own experience, but frustration with their mother's preferences is evident. The 'last time' comment suggests dissatisfaction, but the detailed descriptions and expressed desire to return for the rose wine and ravioli indicate it wasn't a terrible experience overall. Therefore, a 3-star rating reflects the mixed nature of the review.","Took Mom for dinner Monday night. This was the second time I took her here, and it'll be the last! G..."
2,2.0,"The review expresses strong negative sentiment due to consistently poor service from a specific employee over the past 6 months. While the food quality is acknowledged as good, the repeated negative experiences with the bartender overshadow this positive aspect. The customer feels 'betrayed' by the decline in service, despite being a loyal patron, and explicitly states they would not recommend the restaurant. This indicates significant problems outweighing the positive food quality, warranting a 2-star rating.",I am a very loyal customer to pure sushi and have been for over 2 years now. Up until about 6 months...
3,3.0,"The review is mixed. There's strong positive sentiment towards the staff (knowledgeable, helpful, friendly). However, a key reason for the reviewer's visits – D&D books and dice – is no longer available, which is a significant negative. The anime situation is a positive due to price/availability despite quality concerns. The overall tone suggests disappointment about the D&D offerings prevents a higher rating, but the positive staff experience keeps it above neutral.",The sales people here are very knowledgable and helpful. They are also very friendly and great with ...
1,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, filled with insults ('caniaille', 'shit eaters') and disparaging descriptions of the food, service, and wine. While there's a backhanded 'positive' – keeping a certain clientele away from better restaurants – it's delivered with extreme contempt. The intensity is strong due to the harsh language. The specific complaints are slow service, mediocre food, and poor wine quality. This points to a significantly flawed experience, justifying a 2-star rating.","Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that ..."
2,3.0,"The review is mixed. Initially positive about the food quality and convenience, it turns negative due to a hidden delivery charge and lack of transparency. While the reviewer understands delivery fees in principle, the undisclosed charge and unhelpful delivery driver led to dissatisfaction. The statement 'This will probably be the last time we order' indicates a significant negative impact, but the food itself wasn't *bad*, just not 'great'. This points to a neutral overall experience with notable issues.",We were excited when we found that we could add George and Sons to our delivery list.  The food is g...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""Love,"" ""great,"" and praising the food quality (""spicy and always cooked just right""), menu variety, service, and popularity (""always busy""). The tone is enthusiastic and there are no complaints. This indicates a highly positive experience and a strong recommendation.","Love this place !

5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Strong sentiment indicators like ""wowed,"" ""Damn that was good!"" (even expressed as a desire to say it in German), ""great,"" and ""really good"" are used repeatedly. The reviewer specifically praises the food (German meatloaf, red cabbage, Weihenstephaner) and Chef Hoffman, as well as the patio and service. The social aspect of the Yelp event is also positive. There are no complaints mentioned. The intensity is strong due to the enthusiastic language and lingering positive impression (taking a week to write the review).",I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, comparing Carraba's favorably to Red Robin and repeatedly praising specific dishes (Pollo Rosa Maria, bread, salads). The only negative points are minor – the frozen butter and lack of ranch, and a lukewarm opinion on most desserts. The strong positive language ('must', 'match made in heaven', 'great') outweighs the small complaints, indicating a mostly positive experience.","Like Red Robin, Carraba's is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.

They praise the unique product selection (legitimate bookbinding supplies) and express strong interest in the classes offered, indicating a high level of satisfaction. There are no complaints, only positive observations and future intentions. The tone is enthusiastic and appreciative.",This is one of the only places in Phoenix that carries legitimate book binding supplies like book cl...
3,4.0,"The review is largely positive, with strong praise for the beef gyro and falafel, and a comment on good portion sizes for the price. The hummus portion is a specific complaint, but it's relatively minor. The bartender's friendliness is inconsistent, which is a slight negative, but doesn't overshadow the positives. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, suggesting a mostly positive experience.",Their beef gyro's are delicious!  Great portions for what you pay.  And their falafel is really good...
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'fav,' 'great,' 'fun,' and 'steal.' The intensity is moderate to strong due to repeated positive descriptors and enthusiastic praise for specific items (Vegas roll price). There are no complaints, only recommendations for various sushi experience levels. While not *ecstatic* praise, it's a very strong recommendation, leaning towards a 4 rather than a 5 as it doesn't express exceptional delight, just consistent satisfaction.",One of my fav sushi places in the Valley.  Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or ...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the pizzeria as a welcome change from Chicago-style pizza and highlighting friendly staff, convenient location, and a good selection. The initial jab at other pizza styles is playful rather than genuinely negative. The intensity is moderate to strong in its praise, with only a mildly negative comment directed at other pizza preferences. The suggestion to use it instead of the AMC concession stand further reinforces a positive experience.","So great to see the occasional NY style pizzeria pop up amid all these chi-town ""pizza"" impersonator..."
3,3.0,"The review is largely mixed. While the reviewer expresses confusion and disappointment with the venue's identity ('Meh' for drinks and crowd), they acknowledge positive aspects like the layout, friendly bouncers, and potential for parties due to the rooftop and dance floor. The 'A-Okay' comment and willingness to return suggest a neutral leaning towards positive, but not strong enough for a 4-star rating. The initial negative framing and 'Meh' assessments hold it back from being higher.",I don't know what Bar Smith is trying to be. I feel like instead of just saying okay we are going to...
1,2.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative despite the attempt at a 'positive sandwich'. While the location and staff friendliness are noted, the core experience – food and service – is heavily criticized. The food descriptions ('ashtray', 'lifeless') are strong negative indicators, and the service issues (being ignored, long waits) are significant. The reviewer explicitly states they won't recommend it and will likely avoid it, despite acknowledging others enjoy it. This points to a fundamentally poor personal experience, outweighing the limited positives.",I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the prov...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like ""LOVE love LOVE"", ""in love"", ""favie"", and describing the service as ""friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine"". The only negative aspect is a wish for more locations, which doesn't detract from the positive experience with the product and service itself. The intensity is very strong due to the repeated emphasis and enthusiastic language.",I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out t...
3,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting delicious noodles, fast service, huge portions, and cheap prices. The only negative is the lack of vegetables, which is a minor complaint. The strong desire to keep eating (and suspicion of MSG) is presented more as a humorous observation than a serious issue. Therefore, a 4-star rating is appropriate, indicating mostly positive experience with a small area for improvement.",The noodles are delicious here. I had the vegetarian spicy noodle. It doesn't come with anything but...
1,1.0,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, using strong negative descriptors like ""crappy,"" ""grumpy,"" and expressing a firm intention to never return. Multiple issues are cited – slow service, incompetent staff, unfriendly hosts, and poor food quality – all contributing to a significantly negative experience. The impact on the customer's leisure time (2 hours lost) further emphasizes the severity of the problems.","Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food tha..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like 'Amazing,' 'Fast,' 'Clean,' 'Fresh,' and 'Friendly.'

There are no complaints or negative comments.","Amazing sushi. Fast, clean, fresh. Friendly staff. Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy ..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting a fun atmosphere, excellent staff, and a wide variety of sushi. The only significant complaint is the lack of spice, which is a minor issue.

4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting cleanliness, speed of service, and ample space. The author expresses pleasure and uses positive language ('pleased,' 'happy,' 'golden'). The initial 4-star rating is maintained as a comparison to other Chipotle locations, suggesting this one is above average but not perfect. There are no significant complaints.","The 4 stars is in comparison to other Chipotle's I've been to, especially in this area.

4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'Great' and 'best'. The mention of it 'never being too crowded' is also a strong positive. While concise, it lacks detail preventing a 5-star rating, but is still highly favorable.","Great place to see a show.  Prices are the best around, and it's never too crowded."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, despite acknowledging inconsistent service. The reviewer explicitly recommends the cafe ('don't think you will be disappointed'), praises specific menu items (omelettes, burgers, sandwiches), and highlights the quality of ingredients and drinks. The 'not always the greatest' service is downplayed as expected for this type of establishment. The tone is relaxed and enthusiastic, indicating a positive experience.",Usually stop here for breakfast and mimosas. Agreed the service is not always the greatest but who e...
4,3.0,"The review is mixed. There's positive feedback about the airport's cleanliness, shopping, and food options, as well as the rental car area. However, there are significant negative points: a very long walk to certain gates, problematic security screening, and a lengthy rental car shuttle ride. These issues prevent a higher rating, but the positives keep it from being a 1 or 2-star review. It's an acceptable airport, but with notable inconveniences.","Nice clean airport with lots of places to shop and lots of food options.  Terminal 4 is nice.

4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, filled with enthusiastic language (""holy mecca of cupcake land"", ""MERCY"", ""worth every cent""). The author clearly adored the cupcakes and the helpful service. The only significant negative is the limited drink selection, which is a minor inconvenience. The quirky details (decor, friend's car) add to the charm and don't detract from the experience. Therefore, a 4-star rating reflects the mostly positive experience with a small drawback.","While doing a bicycle ride to the Orange Table, I pointed to a friend that LuLus Cupcakes was access..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, expressing strong gratitude and admiration for the theater owner's dedication to showing independent and foreign films in Phoenix.

4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'exceeded expectations,' 'outstanding,' 'tasty,' 'fresh,' and 'very impressed.' The wait time is framed as a positive sign of fresh preparation. While the menu is described as 'par' (neutral), the food quality is highly praised. The only minor drawback is the initial wait, but it's presented as acceptable. The detailed description of the atmosphere and beverage options adds to the positive impression. The price point of $11 for two people is also a positive factor.",El Taco de Chandler exceeded my expectations.  I've driven past it almost every day for a year.  My ...
3,3.0,"The review is mixed. There's positive sentiment regarding the service (when good) and the overall 'fun night' atmosphere, but significant negatives like a burger with no taste, bad pancakes, and the observation that the clientele are 'drunk people'. The intensity is moderate - the issues aren't catastrophic, but noticeable. The 'Arik B' anecdote adds a bizarre element, but doesn't necessarily indicate a widespread problem. Chicken strips are 'a-ok' which is neutral. Overall, it suggests an acceptable experience with some clear drawbacks.",Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can ...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the beer selection, crab cakes, and atmosphere. The main complaint is the music, and the reviewer offers a solution (a DJ, even volunteering themselves!).

The reviewer explicitly states they will return, indicating satisfaction.","I finally went here, after reading the reviews and pouting about how busy I was with work and how it..."

4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting 'great food,' 'good prices,' 'fresh and lite' chips, and enjoyable experiences with friends. While the reviewer acknowledges needing to try more dishes before a higher rating, the existing praise is strong. The mention of finding another great restaurant doesn't detract significantly as it's presented as a separate observation, not a direct comparison negatively impacting Abuelo's. The tone is enthusiastic and appreciative.",wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company...

4,3.0,"The review is mixed. Dinner was good but lacked a punch in flavor, while brunch was great. The biggest negative is the service, described as 'uninterested' and burdened, but it doesn't ruin the overall experience. This points to a generally acceptable experience with room for improvement, landing at a 3-star rating.","Had dinner and brunch, not on the same day...the dinner was good, although I thought the mandala mas..."
3,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the courses as 'great', 'fun', 'fantastic', and the burgers as 'liked'. While it acknowledges it's not a destination course and the front nine is 'mini-golfing' like (which isn't necessarily negative), these are minor points. The scenic views and quick round time are strong positives. The tone is enthusiastic and personal ('local fave').","Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an o..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the food quality (brochette, spaghetti & meatballs, chicken toscana) and authenticity. While there are two specific complaints (bright lights and prepackaged butter/lack of fresh Parmesan), they are relatively minor and don't detract significantly from the overall positive experience. The reviewer explicitly states 'no complaints about the food (delicious!)' and offers a 'highly recommended' endorsement. The star deduction was clearly articulated as being for ambiance and a minor preference, not a major flaw.","I had my first meal at Miele's last night, and was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased a Groupon to t..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Words like ""fantastic,"" ""fun,"" ""friendly,"" ""great,"" and ""tasty"" indicate strong positive sentiment. The reviewer expresses excitement and a desire to return. The only slight drawback is the acknowledgement of ""some kinks"" being worked out, preventing a 5-star rating, but this is presented as a temporary issue with a positive outlook.",Sure it's walking distance from my house - so I was hoping I would have a new place for my morning t...
1,2.0,"The review is largely negative, despite acknowledging it's better for families. Sentiment indicators include ""outrageous,"" ""huge distraction,"" ""so-so,"" and ""don't love it."" The intensity is moderate to strong due to the direct criticism of price and quality. While the reviewer notes families seem happy, their personal experience is poor, and the only positives are minor (gift shop, glasses). The opening line, ""Take your money elsewhere,"" is a strong negative indicator.","Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family membe..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using enthusiastic language (""Yum yum yum!"", ""the bomb!"", ""on point!"") and highlighting consistent quality over numerous visits (30+ times). Specific praise is given for the food (chips, salsas, Whitesands chimichanga, lunch specials, margaritas), the atmosphere (kids eat free on Sundays with entertainment), and the added bonus of a microbrewery. The only neutral comment is regarding the beer, as the reviewer doesn't drink it. The intensity is strong due to the repeated positive descriptors and clear enthusiasm.",Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my...
4,4.0,"The review is largely positive, highlighting excellent service, atmosphere, beer selection, and reasonable value. While the food doesn't *quite* live up to expectations (7/10 taste), it's still considered 'good'. The reviewer explicitly states they'd return for drinks and appetizers, and the overall score is 25/30, translating to 4/5 stars. The initial excitement fading is a minor drawback, not a dealbreaker.","I was here not too long ago.  The place is cute and when you look at the menu, you can't help but be..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. Phrases like ""so delicious"" and ""pretty delicious"" indicate strong enjoyment of the food (ravioli and miso soup). While the wine is only ""ok,"" the reviewer actively recommends an alternative, suggesting a positive experience with other beverages. The connection to a positive family experience (mom's favorite) adds to the favorable sentiment. The overall tone is appreciative and recommending, with only a minor critique regarding the wine.",I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months. This is one of my mom'...
3,3.0,"The review expresses mixed feelings. While the food is deemed 'OK' and the restaurant is 'well furnished and clean' (positive aspects), the overall sentiment is lukewarm ('isn't all that') and the reviewer explicitly states there are better options for the price. The tone is somewhat dismissive, questioning the positive hype. This points to a neutral experience with some positives offset by significant drawbacks, landing at a 3-star rating.",This place isn't all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like ""freaking good,"" ""great,"" ""absolutely delicious,"" and ""love everything."" The tone is enthusiastic and expresses a desire to visit more often. The mention of a secret menu item (""the icon"") adds to the positive experience. There are no complaints, only praise for drinks, food, and service.","So freaking good.  The drinks are great too.  Ask for ""the icon"" not on menu, but very good!

5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'excellent,' 'wonderful,' and 'extremely flavorful.' It specifically recommends dishes, indicating a strong positive experience. There are no complaints, and the portion size is also praised. This points to a highly satisfying dining experience.",Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful ...
4,4.0,"The review is largely positive, despite some reservations. While the reviewer notes a shift in clientele and price ('a bit pricey') and uses somewhat dramatic language ('bohemian bloodletting', 'authoritarian overlords'), the overall tone is appreciative. They explicitly state they 'do enjoy' the coffee shop and find it a 'nice place for coffee' with a 'cozy, neighborly feel'. The praise for the location and its integration with the historic neighborhood adds to the positive impression. The criticisms are mild and framed as observations about change rather than severe flaws.","I do enjoy this coffee shop, though admittedly it has largely subscribed to bohemian bloodletting si..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting multiple dishes the reviewers enjoy (Pad Thai, Chow Mein, Chicken Satay, Spring Rolls) and praising the service and price. The only significant negative is the dislike of the Sweet and Sour Pork, which while important to the reviewer, doesn't overshadow the many positives. The enthusiastic tone ('WHOOP WHOOP!', 'in love right now') indicates strong positive sentiment.",Thai Basil is just delicious! I love Thai food but i try not t drag the bf along too much since he h...
3,3.0,"The review expresses generally positive sentiment with praise for the appetizer platter, lemonade, and service (attentive waitress and manager check-in). However, the reviewer states it was a 'light dinner' suggesting it wasn't fully satisfying, and the final rating is explicitly 3 stars, indicating a mixed experience. There are no strong negative indicators, but also no overwhelming praise that would warrant a 4 or 5-star rating.",My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hum...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, especially considering the reviewer's self-proclaimed 'pizza snob' status as a New Yorker. Specific praise is given for the crust, mozzarella, and toppings. The 'a little greasy' comment is framed as a positive, aligning with NY-style pizza. The tone is enthusiastic ('Yo! Tony!') and complimentary. While the reviewer notes the lack of a Ray's location, they favorably compare the pizza to Mamma Mia's, indicating satisfaction. The only minor drawback is the lack of a Ray's in their area, which isn't a criticism of the pizza itself.",Never been in - but I get pizza delivered from them now and then. I am a New Yorker and to call me a...
5,4.0,"The review begins with a stated dislike for botanical gardens, indicating initial negative sentiment. However, this is strongly countered by enthusiastic praise for the Desert Botanical Gardens, highlighting its unique and fascinating plant life and wildlife. The tone shifts from cynical to appreciative. While the initial sentiment is negative, the overwhelming focus and intensity of the positive descriptions lead to a high rating. The reviewer explicitly states the gardens are exceptional and 'never grow old,' indicating high satisfaction. There are no significant complaints.","I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too ""perfect"" to be of much int..."
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer and her husband both enjoyed their drinks, and while the turkey burger was 'standard,' the fries were excellent and the carne adovada received high praise. The atmosphere is described as 'great' and 'fun.' The overall tone is enthusiastic and includes a strong recommendation. The only minor drawback is the 'standard' turkey burger, preventing a 5-star rating.",Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the ...
4,3.0,"The review is mixed. Two dishes received a 3-star rating, indicating they were average. The curry was praised as 'really good,' a positive, but it only 'made up for the others' suggesting it didn't elevate the overall experience significantly. The fresh coconut water and reasonable price ($30) are additional positives, but the average performance of most items keeps the rating at a neutral 3 stars.","We went over for dinner- had the spring rolls, chicken curry, and lemongrass chicken. The spring rol..."
2,2.0,"The review is largely negative, despite praise for the nachos. The core food quality is described as 'decent, slightly overpriced' and 'just OK,' with direct comparisons to better alternatives. The service is a major issue, described as 'awful' with specific, frustrating examples. While the nachos are a strong positive, the overall experience is marred by poor service and value, leading to an irritated feeling. The strong recommendation to go to a competitor further reinforces the negative sentiment.","I've been here a few times now and I would say it is decent, slightly overpriced Mexican food. Their..."
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like ""terrific,"" ""amazed,"" ""impeccable,"" ""wonderful,"" and ""lovely."" While the reviewer acknowledges the cost of tickets is a barrier, they strongly advocate for the value and memorable experience of live theater, specifically praising the actors and harmonies. The tone is enthusiastic and appreciative, leading to a clear strong recommendation.","01/04/2012

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific perfor..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the food (sampler, tostones) and acknowledging the restaurant's ability to create a pleasant atmosphere despite a busy location. The political commentary, while present, is framed as appreciative of Cuban cuisine and doesn't detract from the positive food review. The tone is enthusiastic and playful ('going bananas'). While the political remarks might be off-putting to some, they don't impact the assessment of the restaurant itself.",In spite of being on the corner of 44th and Camelback it does a good job of insulating you from the ...
1,1.0,"The review uses extremely negative language (""Disgusting!""), describes a highly unpleasant atmosphere, and criticizes the food's lack of flavor. The reviewer also expresses strong distrust of other reviews, suggesting a belief that positive feedback is fabricated. This indicates a severely negative experience and warrants a 1-star rating.",Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style in...
2,3.0,"The review expresses mixed feelings. While the food is described as 'decent' and the service 'good', the reviewer strongly criticizes the high cost and perceived pretentiousness. The comparison to similar quality food available at a much lower price point (Public Market) is a significant negative. The tone is generally critical, though not overly harsh, and the reviewer explicitly states they wouldn't return soon. This points to a neutral experience with notable drawbacks, fitting a 3-star rating.",I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just loo...
3,3.0,"The review is largely mixed. While the reviewer appreciates the happy hour, atmosphere, and service, the loud music is a significant detractor. Praise for the ribs is qualified by the need to order double due to small portions, and the reviewer is ambivalent about returning. The 'Three solid stars' statement confirms a neutral overall sentiment.","Okay, so I like Canteen and all, but dear Lord, let's turn that music down a notch! These guys have ..."
4,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong praise like ""outstanding"" and ""fabulous."" The reviewer explicitly states the establishment is ""reliably good"" and makes an exception to their general avoidance of chains, indicating high satisfaction. There are no complaints, only praise for the variety of offerings (beer, ciders, cocktails, pizza, healthy menu).","Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous ""bitch fizz"" (ciders, etc.) and cock..."
2,2.0,"The review is largely negative, despite some humorous recounting of events. The core experience revolves around misfortune – a broken-down car, unhelpful patrons, and a feeling of being stranded. While the reviewer finds humor in the situation and praises the Mexican teenagers who helped, the initial experience and overall atmosphere of the gas station are portrayed as unsettling and problematic. The 'Bermuda Triangle' analogy and descriptions like 'suspicious siren' and 'sketching out' indicate a strong negative sentiment. The reliance on external help to resolve a basic issue (a dead car battery) further detracts from the station's value.","This gas station is like the bermuda triangle of gas stations!
I came here w/ a friend on a first fr..."
1,2.0,"The review expresses strong negative sentiment regarding the service, citing long wait times and a rude server. While the food is only described as 'okay' (neutral), the poor service significantly impacts the overall experience. The customer explicitly states they 'won't be going back,' indicating a strong dissatisfaction. This points to a mostly negative experience with significant problems, justifying a 2-star rating.","The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our ta..."
4,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'satisfies,' 'delicious,' and 'happy.' The tone is enthusiastic and highlights a successful experience catering to diverse preferences. There are no complaints, only praise for both pizzas ordered. This indicates a strong recommendation.","Finally, a pizza place that satisfies the individual pizza taste buds of my family! We ordered the R..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like ""right up my alley,"" ""awesome,"" and multiple ""check"" marks indicating satisfaction with key features. The 4 & 1/4 stars suggests a very good experience with only minor, unstated drawbacks. The tone is enthusiastic and appreciative.","This place is right up my alley.

5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like 'amazing,' 'perfect,' 'delicious,' and 'highlight.' The tone is enthusiastic and includes a strong recommendation ('no excuse to not come here') and intent to return despite living in another city. While the initial description of the location is slightly quirky, it doesn't detract from the positive experience. The specific praise for ambiance, wine, and unique food further supports a 5-star rating.",After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office buildi...

There are no complaints, only specific praise for the quality of the ingredients.",The meat and bread is so fresh that it makes Mr. Goodcents my number one sub place to hit up when in...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, stating all dishes tried over a year have been 'good'. While the reviewer notes the spice levels aren't extremely hot, this isn't a complaint, just an observation. The tone is consistently positive, indicating a good experience. The intensity is moderate - consistently 'good' rather than ecstatic, but still clearly favorable.",Been dining here about a year and still trying diff things from the menu and all have been good. I d...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting excellent service, a fantastic restaurant (Taggia), and a generally admirable renovation. The primary negative point is the unfinished room makeovers, described as 'mild-mannered' and having 'disappointing' carpeting. This is a minor issue, and the reviewer acknowledges the significant progress Kimpton has made. The comparison to other hotels is also favorable. Therefore, a 4-star rating is appropriate, indicating mostly positive feedback with minor issues.","As a travel consultant for cre8adventures.com, we came away impressed. This is a moderately priced g..."
4,3.0,"The review is mixed. The reviewer expresses initial love for Pita Jungle and appreciates the ambiance and service greeting. However, there are several notable complaints: the temperature, slow soup service, unappetizing soup, and premature check delivery. While the reviewer doesn't *hate* the place, the number of issues prevents a higher rating. The tone is generally forgiving, but the problems are significant enough to warrant a 3-star rating.","I really love Pita Jungle.  My first experience was at the one downtown, and now, I have to get my f..."
3,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on how much a young child enjoyed the park. While the reviewer only visits *because* of their cousin's interest, the description is enthusiastic and highlights multiple appealing features for young children (train display, ride-on train, stationary trains). The tone is positive and the praise is specific. It's not a 5-star review because the reviewer's personal enjoyment seems secondary to their cousin's, suggesting it's not a place they'd frequent otherwise.",I only go here when my little cousin is in town and he adores this place. My cousin is 4 years old a...
3,3.0,"The review is largely mixed. The reviewer expresses initial enthusiasm but then details several drawbacks: the smell, the music choice, and a general feeling of not quite hitting the mark. While there's praise for the bar structure, beer selection, and cozy nooks, the negative aspects prevent a higher rating. The 'probably' regarding returning for food and waiting for a busier night indicates a lukewarm impression. Overall, it's an acceptable experience with room for improvement.","I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean, a British themed pub in Heritage Squa..."
4,4.0,"The review is largely positive, focusing on a surprisingly excellent sandwich. While there are negative aspects (disturbing decor, shirtless patron), these are framed as exceptions and don't overshadow the positive food experience. The initial expectations were low, making the positive experience even more impactful. The intensity of the negative comments is moderate, and the core experience – the food – is highly praised. The request for better enforcement of a dress code is a minor issue.","With a name like ""The Lodge"", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neig..."
5,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, expressing strong admiration for the site and tour guides. The 'indescribably cool' and 'genius' descriptors indicate high satisfaction. The only negative point is the disrepair of some rooms, but this is presented as a motivator to support the site financially, not a major detractor. The strong recommendation ('This is not to be missed!') further supports a 4-star rating.",I'm not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute ...
5,5.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong sentiment indicators like ""SO glad,"" ""exceeded my wildest expectations,"" ""pleasantly surprised,"" and ""highly recommend."" The reviewer specifically praises the therapist's expertise and intuition, indicating a very satisfying experience. The tone is enthusiastic and the overall impression is extremely favorable.",I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exce...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, despite some service hiccups. The reviewer explicitly states they 'really love it' and raves about the garlic appetizer and pizza. While there are mentions of the server disappearing and a slight wait for a new server, the reviewer downplays these issues, stating they don't require apologies or heartfelt goodbyes. The ambiance is described as 'cozy' and 'romantic,' and the food is consistently praised. The price point is acknowledged as not cheap, but this doesn't detract from the overall positive experience. The strong praise for specific dishes and the overall tone indicate a 4-star experience.","I didn't pay much attention to this place for several years.  Passed it many times, just didn't catc..."
3,2.0,"The review expresses negative sentiment primarily due to price. While the food is only described as 'ok' (neutral), the strong negative reaction to the price of the loco moco ('outrageous!') indicates a significant issue. This leads to a mostly negative experience, warranting a 2-star rating.","Food is just ok, but the problem is it's way overpriced! I mean $9 for loco moco? Outrageous!"
1,2.0,"The review expresses strong negative sentiment due to poor customer service. While the reviewer liked the products and intends to purchase directly from the artists, the experience at the store itself was significantly negative (underwhelmed, sub par, lack of acknowledgement). The tone is disappointed and frustrated. This warrants a 2-star rating as the core issue is a significant problem, despite appreciation for the products themselves.",I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over th...
3,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using strong positive language like ""deeee-licious"", ""loooooooooooove"", ""genius!!!"", and ""adore"". While there's a noted discomfort with the perceived 'trendy' atmosphere and the price is considered high, the taste and quality of ingredients consistently win out. The comparison to CPK as a positive alternative further reinforces a favorable opinion. The negative aspects are more about personal preference/feeling than actual flaws in the food or service.","the food here is deeee-licious. i like the decor, the ambiance, the menu, the waitstaff. however, i ..."
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like 'enjoyed,' 'fancy,' 'modern,' and 'LIKE' (with emphasis). The exclamation point and 'Mmmmm!' further indicate strong positive sentiment. While brief, the praise is specific (sweet potato fries) and there are no complaints. The slightly unusual framing (reviewing for a boyfriend) doesn't detract from the positive experience described.",My boyfriend just reviewed this place and although we have never  been here together - I thought tha...
3,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting good service, a clean environment, and enjoyable food and drinks. The use of 'YUMMIE' indicates strong positive sentiment towards the burrito. There are no complaints, only praise, suggesting a very positive experience.

This indicates a highly satisfying experience.",Have you ever eaten somewhere and just can't get the craving out of your head and you have to go bac...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive. While acknowledging it was crowded and service was a bit slow (minor negatives), the reviewer specifically praises the quality of the food – moist, smoky pork with a tasty sauce. The 'Good joint. Would return.' statement is a strong indicator of satisfaction. The initial description of the atmosphere, while lively, isn't presented as a negative.",Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened ...
2,3.0,"The review starts with a negative statement (""Not exactly a great place to eat""), but quickly pivots to a conditional positive – it *might* be enjoyable for a specific purpose (shakes/ice cream with a teenager). This mixed sentiment and lack of strong negative descriptors suggest a neutral experience. It's not terrible, but doesn't stand out as good either.",Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shak...
4,4.0,"The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting great drinks, food (specifically the pizza), atmosphere, and friendly staff. The negative comment about the staring man is a significant issue but is downplayed with hope it won't recur, suggesting it didn't ruin the overall experience. Therefore, a 4-star rating reflects the mostly positive experience with a minor, potentially isolated, negative incident.","Great drinks!!!

3,3.0,"The review is largely mixed. There's positive sentiment towards the pita, fire feta, and tea (especially with lemonade). However, the salad, rice, and tzatziki are criticized, and the gyros are only 'decent'. The concluding statement ('wouldn't go out of my way') indicates a lack of strong enthusiasm, suggesting an average experience. The intensity of both praise and criticism is moderate, leaning towards mild.","As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food, this place is pretty good. I like their pita a lot, and t..."

3,3.0,"The review is mixed. Service receives high praise (5 stars, 'awesome,' 'very friendly and professional,' 'every single person greeted us'), and the ambiance is positively described ('pretty cool,' 'burlesque-ish,' 'huge vases of roses'). However, the food is a significant letdown (2.5 stars), with both entrees described as 'bland' and the soup 'salty.' While the dessert was a highlight, the core offering – steak – failed to impress, especially given the reviewers' high standards. The overall tone suggests disappointment with the food despite excellent service, landing it in the mixed/neutral category.","Service - 5 stars (which is so rare). Food 2.5 stars.

3,3.0,"The review is mixed. There's positive feedback regarding the coffee and zucchini bread (moderate intensity - 'solid', 'win', 'cute'). However, a significant negative is expressed regarding the atmosphere – the reviewer doesn't feel relaxed or at home (moderate intensity - 'never been able to').

While acknowledging the price is high, this is presented as a known factor rather than a complaint. The observation about children's tech savviness adds a positive, impressed tone.
